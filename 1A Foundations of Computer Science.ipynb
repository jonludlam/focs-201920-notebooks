Most students will have some programming experience already, but there\nare few people whose programming cannot be improved through greater knowledge\nof basic principles. Please bear this point in mind if you have extensive\nexperience and find parts of the course rather slow.\n\nThe programming in this course is based on the language [OCaml](https://ocaml.org)\nand mostly concerns the functional programming style. Functional programs tend\nto be shorter and easier to understand than their counterparts in conventional\nlanguages such as C. In the space of a few weeks, we shall cover many\nfundamental data structures and learn basic methods for estimating efficiency.\n\n**this is a work-in-progress port of Lawrence C. Paulson's 1819 Cambridge\ncourse notes**\n"

The interface to the higher level should supply the\nadvertised services. Just as important, it should block access to the means by\nwhich those services are implemented. This _abstraction barrier_ allows one\nlevel to be changed without affecting levels above. For example, when a\nmanufacturer designs a faster version of a processor, it is essential that\nexisting programs continue to run on it. Any differences between the old and\nnew processors should be invisible to the program.\n\nModern processors have elaborate specifications, which still sometimes leave\nout important details.

The\nPDP-10 was a 36-bit mainframe computer. It represented dates using a 12-bit\nformat designed for the tiny PDP-8. With 12 bits, one can distinguish\n$2^{12} = 4096$ days or 11 years.\n\nThe most common industry format for dates uses six characters: two for the\nyear, two for the month and two for the day. The most common \"solution\" to the\nyear 2000 crisis is to add two further characters, thereby altering file sizes.\nOthers have noticed that the existing six characters consist of 48 bits,\nalready sufficient to represent all dates over the projected lifetime of the\nuniverse: $2^{48}$ = $2.8 * 1014$ days = $7.7 * 1011$ years!\n\nMathematicians think in terms of unbounded ranges, but the representation we\nchoose for the computer usually imposes hard limits.

The computational equivalent is the _floating\npoint number_. These are familiar to anybody who has used a scientific\ncalculator.  Internally, a float consists of two integers.\n\nBecause of its finite precision, floating-point computations are potentially\ninaccurate. To see an example, use your nearest electronic calculator to\ncompute $(2^{1/10000})10000$. I get $1.99999959$! With certain computations,\nthe errors spiral out of control. Many programming languages fail to check\nwhether even integer computations fall within the allowed range: you can add\ntwo positive integers and get a negative one!\n\nMost computers give us a choice of precisions. In 32-bit precision, integers\ntypically range from $2^{31} − 1$ (namely $2,147,483,647$) to $−2^{31}$; reals\nare accurate to about six decimal places and can get as large as 1035 or so.\nFor reals, 64-bit precision is often preferred. Early languages like Fortran\nrequired variables to be declared as `INTEGER`, `REAL` or `COMPLEX` and barred\nprogrammers from mixing numbers in a computation. Nowadays, programs handle\nmany different kinds of data, including text and symbols. The concept of a\n_data type_ can ensure that different types of data are not combined in a\nsenseless way.\n\nInside the computer, all data are stored as bits. In most programming\nlanguages, the compiler uses types to generate correct machine code, and types\nare not stored during program execution.
